# Brains-Storming-Visualization
This is the project that try to visulaize brain storming about game subject.
First we have gathered all ideas about game in a text format .
The next step is to sotore these text and in the next step preprocessing step to clean these text inputs.
We have implemented Word2vec for embedding and find most similar ideas to each other.
For visualization we should implement T-SNE to reduce the dimensions to 2-dimensions and plot the results with plotly and make dashbpard with dashplot.
